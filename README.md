# Monolithe Stack Example

This repository contains the tutorial used during the CappCon2016 in Liege. It will walk you through the creation of a ToDoList app, from the specification to the UI. As a disclaimer, the user experience for a todo list provided by this tutorial is quite terrible :). We could do way better, but we want to keep things as standard as possible. But when you will be done reading this tutorial, feel free to explore the stacks and see if you can make it way better (hint: you can!)

We will do the following:

- Getting started by installed the prerequisites;
- Installing the Monolithe Specifications Director;
- Improving the a set of Specifications with the Monolithe Specifications Director;
- Build a Garuda backend based on these Specifications;
- Improve a basic NUKit UI to take care of the improvements of the Specifications.

The projects we will be using are:

- [https://github.com/nuagenetworks/bambou](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/bambou)
- [https://github.com/nuagenetworks/objj-bambou](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/objj-bambou)
- [https://github.com/nuagenetworks/monolithe](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/monolithe)

- [https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nukit-theme](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nukit-theme)

We will also use the following Docker images:

- [https://hub.docker.com/r/monolithe/garuda/](https://hub.docker.com/r/monolithe/garuda/)
- [https://hub.docker.com/r/monolithe/specsdirector-client/](https://hub.docker.com/r/monolithe/specsdirector-client/)
- [https://hub.docker.com/r/monolithe/specsdirector-server/](https://hub.docker.com/r/monolithe/specsdirector-server/)

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for this entire tutorial.


## Prerequisites

Fork this repository:

    $ open https://github.com/nuagenetworks/monostack-example/fork

Clone **your fork** on your machine:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/monostack-example.git
    $ cd monostack-example

Create a Python virtual environment:

    $ virtualenv /tmp/monostack && source /tmp/monostack/bin/activate

Install these two Python packages:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/nuagenetworks/bambou.git
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/nuagenetworks/monolithe.git

Pull the docker following images (so the rest will be faster):

    $ docker pull monolithe/garuda
    $ docker pull monolithe/specsdirector-client
    $ docker pull monolithe/specsdirector-server
    $ docker pull redis
    $ docker pull mongo

Generate a GitHub Token:

    $ open https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

Leave all the default values, click on `generate`. Copy the token somewhere

> You won't be able to see it again if you close the page, so keep it somewhere.


## Monolithe Specifications Director

### Installation

Get the docker-compose file for the Specifications Director:

    $ curl -o specifications-director.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuagenetworks/specifications-director/master/docker-compose.yml

Start the Specifications Director:

    $ docker-compose -f specifications-director.yml up -d

You should be able access the Monolithe Specifications Director by running the following command:

    $ open https://$(docker-machine ip)

> Authentication is not enabled. You can log in with any couple of login/password.

The server field needs to be:

    $ echo https://$(docker-machine ip):1984
    https://192.168.99.100:1984

 Log into the Specifications Director

### Add your GitHub token

Click on the top right gear icon, then click on the `+` button and enter the following values:

- Name: `GitHub` (or whatever you like)
- Value: `[YOUR-GITHUB-TOKEN]`

Click on `Create` then click on the `Back` button at the top right corner, to leave the configuration view.

On the main view, click on the `+` button to add a new GitHub Repository and enter the following values:

- Name: `TDLDK` (or whatever you like)
- GitHub API URL: `https://api.github.com`
- Github Repository: `[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]` / `monostack-example` @`master`
- Path to Specifications: `Specifications`
- Token: click on the paper clip to associate your GitHub Token

Click `Create` and it will create the new Repository. Select it.

As this is the first time, the repository will be automatically pulled. When the job is complete, you will see the representation of all the Specifications present in `https://github.com/[your-github-username]/monostack-example/tree/master/Specifications` in the UI.

## Improve the specifications

The current Specifications describe a simple ToDo List api. It has some *Users* and some *Lists* at the root level. *Lists* have some *Tasks*, and *Users* can be associated to a particular *Task*.

We want to add a new top level api *Locations* that will have `name` and `address` as attributes. We also want to be able to associate one (and only one) *Location* to a *List*.

#### Create a Location specification

Select your `TDLDK` Repository then click on the `+` button at the bottom of the list of Specifications to create a new specification. Enter the following values:

- ReST Name: `location`
- Resource Name: `locations` (should be auto populated)
- Entity Name: `Location` (should be auto populated)
- Root API Specification: not checked (default)

Click on `Create`.

#### Create a the attributes for location

Select the newly created *Location* specification. Select the `Attributes` tab, then click the `+` button to add a new attribute. Enter the following values:

- Name: `address`
- Description: `The address of the location.`

Click `Create`.

Create a second one with the following values:

- Name: `name`
- Description: `The name of the location.`

Click `Create`.

Now select the newly created `name` attribute, and on the right hand side editor, scroll down to find and enable the checkbox named `required`.

Then click on the `Update` button at the bottom to save the changes.

#### Make the location a root level api

From the Specifications list, select the one named `root`. Then select the `Children APIs` tab. Click the `+` button to add a new children api:

- Relationship Type: `Parent/Child relationship`
- Specification: Click on the paper clip and select the newly created `location` specification
- Operations (all default):
    - Allow Retrieval: checked
    - Allow Creation: checked
    - Allow Bulk Creation: not checked
    - Allow Bulk Modification: not checked
    - Allow Bulk Deletion: not checked

Then click the `Create` button.

#### Add the association key to the list specification

Select the existing *list* specification in the Specifications list, then go the the `Attributes` tab. Add a new attribute:

- Name: `associatedLocationID`
- Description: `ID of the associated location.`

Then click `Update`.

### Check what you did on GitHub

Every action you did created a commit on GitHub. This allows to have a really cool workflow as you will be able to open pull requests, and review your specifications with the rest of your team. To check that out, Click on the button `GitHub`, on the top right corner to get open the page, then take a look at the commit list.

We didn't do any fork, or branching here, but in a normal scenario, you should. Multiple people can work on their part of the specs, open pull requests that will be merged into the master after review.

You can then click on the `Synchronize` button at any time to pull the latest changes from GitHub. If you are working on a fork, the Specifications Director will also merge back the upstream's master branch right into your development branch when you click the `Synchronize` button.

Life is good!


## TodoList Application

The monostack-example repository already contains the code for the server implementing this Specifications and client to interact with it.

First of all, let's pull our latest changed in the api from GitHub in your local fork:

    $ git pull

Now you should see a `location.spec` in the `Specifications` folder.

### Server

The backend is a Garuda based server. Garuda is a Python application server that will provide everything you need to run your applications based on any Monolithe SDK generated from some Specifications. You will just need to write your custom business logic. Everything else, like CRUD operations, basic validation, push notifications, is completely automatic. It relies on some Monolithe SDK.

Here we'll generate a sdk based the todo list specifications and inject it into out server.

> We won't add any custom business logic in that tutorial, and you will see that for basic operations, you don't need any.

Generate the Python SDK:

    $ monogen --folder Specifications --language python

You can take a look at the generated code in `codegen/python`.

Create an package from the generated code:

    $ cd codegen/python && python setup.py sdist && cd -

Copy the package where our Dockerfile expects it to be:

    $ cp codegen/python/dist/tdldk-1.0.tar.gz Server

Finally let's build and start the ToDoList server using Docker Compose:

    $ cd Server && docker build -t tdlserver . && docker-compose up -d && cd -

Your server is now up and running. As we want to ensure that everything is working as expected, we'll use the cli provided by the generated SDK to try it out.

> As you can see, the exact same SDK is used as a backend with Garuda, as a client library to write your own scripts, and for the cli. Monolithe can also generate SDK in various language such as Go, Objective-J, Java, and also HTML documentation. If you want to take a look at the documentation, run `monogen -f Specifications -L html` and open the `index.html` from `codegen/html` in your browser.

Let's install our generated python package on our local machine:

    $ pip install --upgrade server/tdldk-1.0.tar.gz

In addition to being able to write Python scripts using the SDK, the `tdl` command will now be available. You can give the `tdl` several arguments to pass your credentials and api url. You can also use environment variables which makes it easier. Take a look at the `Tools/rc` file. It exports some variables so we don't have to pass them manually.

To use this, run:

    $ source Tools/rc

> You can also take a look at `Tools/create-locations.py` which is a script that will create 200 locations.

You can check the objects declared in the api by doing:

    $ tdl objects
    [Success] 4 objects found.
    +-----------+
    | Name      |
    |-----------|
    | lists     |
    | locations |
    | tasks     |
    | users     |
    +-----------+

We can now create a *List*:

    $ tdl create list -p name="My First List" description="Very cool list indeed"
    [Success] list has been created with ID=56f61a853b959c0017344cec
    +----------------------+--------------------------+
    | description          | Very cool list indeed    |
    | associatedLocationID |                          |
    | parentType           |                          |
    | lastUpdatedDate      | 1458969221.02            |
    | parentID             |                          |
    | owner                | root                     |
    | creationDate         | 1458969221.02            |
    | ID                   | 56f61a853b959c0017344cec |
    | name                 | My First List            |
    +----------------------+--------------------------+

Or a *Location*:

    $ tdl create location -p name="Nuage Networks" address="380 N Bernardo Ave, Mountain View, CA 94043"
    [Success] location has been created with ID=56f61a943b959c0011344cec
    +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
    | name            | Nuage Networks                              |
    | parentID        |                                             |
    | parentType      |                                             |
    | lastUpdatedDate | 1458969236.99                               |
    | address         | 380 N Bernardo Ave, Mountain View, CA 94043 |
    | owner           | root                                        |
    | creationDate    | 1458969236.99                               |
    | ID              | 56f61a943b959c0011344cec                    |
    +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+

You can get a more machine-friendly output using the `--json` option:

    $ tdl list locations --json
    [
        {
            "name": "Nuage Networks",
            "parentID": null,
            "parentType": null,
            "lastUpdatedDate": 1458969236.0,
            "address": "380 N Bernardo Ave, Mountain View, CA 94043",
            "owner": "root",
            "creationDate": 1458969236.0,
            "ID": "56f61a943b959c0011344cec"
        }
    ]

Everything is working as expected.


### Client

> You need Xcode to work on the UI. It is also preferable that you understand Cappuccino. The goal of this tutorial is not explain how Cappuccino works. If you don't know Cappuccino or should you need any additional information, please visit http://cappuccino-project.org. Cappuccino rocks!

Let's see about the client. You will need Cappuccino to be installed in order to have this to work. To install it if you don't have it:

> if you already have cappuccino installed, be sure to be on the latest master. You can simply go to `Client/Libraries/Cappuccino` and run `jake install` from here.

    $ export CAPP_BUILD="/tmp/cappbuild"
    $ cd Client && ./buildApp --cappuccino --cappinstalldir=/tmp/narwhal
    $ export PATH="/tmp/narwhal/bin:$PATH"

Let's build the rest of the needed libraries:

    $ git submodule update --init # just in case you missed the --recursive during clone :)
    $ ./buildApp -L

> You now need to manage this project with XcodeCapp. Simply drop the `Client` folder into the XcodeCapp icon and add `/tmp/narwhal/bin` in the `Additional Toolchain Path` list.

Now, generate the Objective-J SDK with Monolithe and put it where it should be:

    $ cd ..
    $ monogen -f Specifications -L objj
    $ mkdir Client/Models && cp -a codegen/objj/* Client/Models
    $ cd Client

Open a new Terminal window to serve the local directory:

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Come back to your main terminal, and access the UI:

    open http://127.0.0.1:8000

You can log in using any credentials, but if you want to see the list and location you created before with the cli, the user name needs to be `root` as this is the one that is defined in the `Tools/rc`. The created objects belongs to that user and will only be visible by him. The server address should be:

    $ echo http://$(docker-machine ip):3000
    http://192.168.99.100:3000

Now you can play around the UI and see how everything is working smoothly :).

One thing you'll notice is that the new location api is nowhere to be found. This is because we are going to add the needed code to build the UI for it.

We want to add the location UI in the configuration panel, near the *Users*. So let's do this.

#### The Data View

We need a data view to display the location. NUKit provides some code templates for it, so let's use it:

    $ cp Libraries/NUKit/Tools/Templates/SourceCode/DataView.j DataViews/SKLocationDataView.j

It also provide a tool to generate the needed import file:

    $ cd DataViews && ../Libraries/NUKit/Tools/genimp -r && cd -

You can see that the content of `DataViews/DataViews.j` has been updated. Now we need to edit `DataViews/SKLocationDataView.j` and make it look like:

```objj
@import <Foundation/Foundation.j>
@import <NUKit/NUAbstractDataView.j>


@implementation SKLocationDataView : NUAbstractDataView
{
    @outlet CPTextField fieldAddress;
    @outlet CPTextField fieldName;
}

- (void)bindDataView
{
    [super bindDataView];

    [fieldAddress bind:CPValueBinding toObject:_objectValue withKeyPath:@"address" options:nil];
    [fieldName bind:CPValueBinding toObject:_objectValue withKeyPath:@"name" options:nil];
}

- (id)initWithCoder:(CPCoder)aCoder
{
    if (self = [super initWithCoder:aCoder])
    {
        fieldAddress = [aCoder decodeObjectForKey:@"fieldAddress"];
        fieldName = [aCoder decodeObjectForKey:@"fieldName"];
    }

    return self;
}

- (void)encodeWithCoder:(CPCoder)aCoder
{
    [super encodeWithCoder:aCoder];

    [aCoder encodeObject:fieldAddress forKey:@"fieldAddress"];
    [aCoder encodeObject:fieldName forKey:@"fieldName"];
}

@end
```

We need to prepare the data views loader and add one outlet for this new data view. This object is responsible to register all the data views in a central places, so they can be accessed easily from anywhere you need them.

Edit `DataViews/DataViewLoader.j` and make it look like:

```objj
@import <Foundation/Foundation.j>
@import <NUKit/NUAbstractDataViewsLoader.j>

@import "DataViews.j"


@implementation DataViewsLoader : NUAbstractDataViewsLoader
{
    @outlet SKListDataView      listDataView     @accessors(readonly);
    @outlet SKLocationDataView  locationDataView @accessors(readonly); // added our new data view here
    @outlet SKTaskDataView      taskDataView     @accessors(readonly);
    @outlet SKUserDataView      userDataView     @accessors(readonly);
}

@end
```

Finally we need to edit `Resources/SharedDataViews.xib` to add our new `SKLocationDataView`:

- Drop a new custom view
- Set its class name to be SKLocationDataView
- Add one text field, and connect it to the data view's `fieldName` outlet
- Add another text field, and connect it to the data view's `fieldAddress` outlet
- connect the newly created data view to the File's Owner `locationDataView` outlet.

![animation](Images/tuto-shareddataviews-xib.gif)

#### The Location Module

We need a module to manage the list of *Locations*. Again, let's use the NUKit templates:

    $ cp Libraries/NUKit/Tools/Templates/SourceCode/Module.j ViewControllers/SKLocationsModule.j
    $ cp Libraries/NUKit/Tools/Templates/XIBs/LeafModule.xib Resources/Locations.xib
    $ cd ViewControllers && ../Libraries/NUKit/Tools/genimp -r && cd -

Now edit the `ViewControllers/SKLocationsModule.j` and make it look like:

```objj
@import <Foundation/Foundation.j>
@import <NUKit/NUModule.j>
@import "../Models/Models.j"


@implementation SKLocationsModule : NUModule

+ (CPString)moduleName
{
    return @"Locations";
}

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    [self registerDataViewWithName:@"locationDataView" forClass:SKLocation];
}

- (void)configureContexts
{
    var context = [[NUModuleContext alloc] initWithName:@"Location" identifier:[SKLocation RESTName]];
    [context setPopover:popover];
    [context setFetcherKeyPath:@"childrenLocations"];
    [self registerContext:context forClass:SKLocation];
}

- (BOOL)shouldManagePushOfType:(CPString)aType forEntityType:(CPString)entityType
{
    return entityType === [SKLocation RESTName];
}

- (BOOL)shouldProcessJSONObject:(id)aJSONObject ofType:(CPString)aType eventType:(CPString)anEventType
{
    return aType === [SKLocation RESTName];
}

@end
```

We said that we want to display this module at the same level than the *Users* module. The *Users* module is actually a sub module of the principal module `SKConfigurationModule`. So let's add our `SKLocationsModule` as a submodule too.

Edit `ViewControllers/SKConfigurationModule.j` and make it look like:

```objj
@import <Foundation/Foundation.j>
@import <NUKit/NUModule.j>
@import "../Models/Models.j"

@class SKUsersModule
@class SKLocationsModule


@implementation SKConfigurationModule: NUModule
{
    @outlet CPButton            buttonBack @accessors(readonly);

    @outlet SKLocationsModule   locationsModule; // we add our new module here
    @outlet SKUsersModule       usersModule;
}


#pragma mark -
#pragma mark Initialization

+ (CPString)moduleName
{
    return @"Configuration";
}

+ (CPImage)moduleIcon
{
    return CPImageInBundle(@"toolbar-configuration.png");
}

+ (BOOL)isTableBasedModule
{
    return NO;
}

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    [viewTitleContainer setBackgroundColor:NUSkinColorBlack];
    [viewTitleContainer setBorderBottomColor:nil];

    [self setSubModules:[usersModule, locationsModule]]; // and we add it to the list of submodules.
}

@end
```

We now need to edit the `Resources/Configuration.xib`:

- Add a new View Controller.
- Set its class name to be `SKLocationsModule`
- Set the NIB Name the `SKLocationsModule` to be `Locations`
- Connect the File's Owner outlet `locationsModule` to the `SKLocationsModule` object.

![animation](Images/tuto-configuration-xib.gif)

Finally, we need to work on the `Locations.xib`

- Set the File's Owner class name to be `SKLocationsModule`
- Set the Main View title to be `Locations`
- Set the Getting Started View informations if you like
- On the Popover view:
    - change the `Description` label to be `Address`
    - select the field under the `Description` label, and update its runtime attribute `tag` to be `address`
    - select the red validation field above the field, and update its runtime attribute `tag` to be `validation_address`

![animation](Images/tuto-locations-xib.gif)

#### The Location Associator

The last thing we need to do is to be able to associate a *Location* to a *List*. To do so, we need an associator:

    $ cp Libraries/NUKit/Tools/Templates/SourceCode/Associator.j Associators/SKLocationAssociator.j
    $ cd Associators && ../Libraries/NUKit/Tools/genimp -r && cd -

Now edit `Associators/SKLocationAssociator.j` and make it look like:

```objj
@import <Foundation/Foundation.j>
@import <NUKit/NUAbstractSimpleObjectAssociator.j>
@import "../Models/Models.j"


@implementation SKLocationAssociator : NUAbstractSimpleObjectAssociator

- (CPArray)currentActiveContextIdentifiers
{
    return [[SKLocation RESTName]];
}

- (CPDictionary)associatorSettings
{
    return @{
                [SKLocation RESTName]: @{
                    NUObjectAssociatorSettingsDataViewNameKey: @"locationDataView",
                    NUObjectAssociatorSettingsAssociatedObjectFetcherKeyPathKey: @"childrenLocations"
                }
            };
}

- (CPString)emptyAssociatorTitle
{
    return @"No selected location";
}

- (CPString)titleForObjectChooser
{
    return @"Select a location";
}

- (CPString)keyPathForAssociatedObjectID
{
    return @"associatedLocationID";
}

- (NUVSDObject)parentOfAssociatedObjects
{
    return [SKRoot current];
}

@end
```

We need to use this associator in the `ViewControllers/SKListsModule.j`.

Edit the file and make it look like:

```objj
@import <Foundation/Foundation.j>
@import <NUKit/NUModule.j>
@import "../Models/Models.j"

@class SKTasksModule


@implementation SKListsModule : NUModule
{
    @outlet SKTasksModule tasksModule;
    @outlet SKLocationAssociator locationAssociator; // we add an outlet to our associator here
}

+ (BOOL)automaticSelectionSaving
{
    return NO;
}

+ (CPString)moduleName
{
    return @"Lists";
}

+ (CPImage)moduleIcon
{
    return [SKList icon];
}

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    [self registerDataViewWithName:@"listDataView" forClass:SKList];

    [self setSubModules:[tasksModule]];
}

- (void)configureContexts
{
    var context = [[NUModuleContext alloc] initWithName:@"Lists" identifier:[SKList RESTName]];
    [context setPopover:popover];
    [context setFetcherKeyPath:@"childrenLists"];
    [self registerContext:context forClass:SKList];
}

- (BOOL)shouldManagePushOfType:(CPString)aType forEntityType:(CPString)entityType
{
    return entityType === [SKList RESTName];
}

- (BOOL)shouldProcessJSONObject:(id)aJSONObject ofType:(CPString)aType eventType:(CPString)anEventType
{
    return (aType === [SKList RESTName]);
}

// we add this delegate to set the current edited object to be the object managed by the associator
- (void)moduleContext:(NUModuleContext)aContext willManageObject:(NURESTObject)anObject
{
    [locationAssociator setCurrentParent:anObject];
}

// we add this delegate to reset the associator when the popover is closed
- (void)moduleContext:(NUModuleContext)aContext didManageObject:(NURESTObject)anObject
{
    [locationAssociator setCurrentParent:nil];
}

@end
```

Finally, edit `Resources/Lists.xib`:

- Add a new View into the Popover view of size around the same than the `SKLocationDataView`
- Add a new View Controller:
    - Set its class name to be `SKLocationAssociator`
    - Connect your newly created View to the `view` its outlet
- Connect the File's Owner outlet `locationAssociator` to the `SKLocationAssociator`

## And we are done!

Reload the UI, and enjoy what you have done! As you can see, you create full fledge features with very little code. We've just scratched the surface of what can be done with Monolithe Stack, and you need more information, you can checkout the various repositories using in this tutorial, and especially the source code of the Monolithe Specifications Director, which is a very complete application.

We are using this stack and processes at (Nuage Networks)[https://nuagenetworks.net] for quite a while, and our life is a breathe since then.

We hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and we can't wait to see what awesome things you will build using this stack.

Happy coding!
